--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Added mappings for Wolpertinger's Tankard and Parrot Cage (Cockatiel)
	- Fix zone filtering for zones with empty sub zone names.
	- Might help to include AceDB-3.0 in the list of files to load. Oops.
	- Give pets which are set as Favorite precedence in the sorted list.
